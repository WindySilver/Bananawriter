# Bananawriter

A command line application made with Java for April Fool's 2021. Definitely inspired by Damon L. Wakes's Banana Stories.

To run this, navigate to the right folder on the command prompt/terminal/whatever it is called on your system and run the command "java -jar bananawriter.jar". Note that you need to have Java installed on your system to run it and command.txt in the same folder as the jar for it to work!

As of the 1.0 release, there are three commands: write, randomize and exit. You can get their descriptions in the app by using either "help" or "?" with their name (for example, "help write" gives the description for the write command).

Have fun!
